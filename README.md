ColocationPatternMinning
========================

This repository is the code implementing some classic algorithms in co-location pattern minning.

As you can see, there are four packages in every version's directory.
###basic
The code in this package implements Apriori algorithm by Rakesh Agrawal, one of the most classic alogrithm for association rules minning.
###joinbase
implementing the joinbase algorithm by Yan Huang.
###joinless
implementing the joinless algorithm by Jin Soung Yoo.
###test
code written for various test
